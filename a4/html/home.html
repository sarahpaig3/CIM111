<h2>Visit Sunny Isles Beach</h2>
<br>
<p>The atmosphere in Sunny Isles Beach is casual. The funky 50â€™s motels and small beachfront hotels are giving way to luxury apartment towers and hotels. However, little has changed on the Newport Fishing Pier, where you can drop a line and fish from shore. For real deep-sea fishing, head to the charter boats docked on the Intracoastal Waterway at Haulover Beach Park. Across the way, a one-mile stretch of white sand and open ocean surf invites sunbathing and swimming. Oleta River State Park is a popular destination for kayaking and biking.
<br>
The Dezer Collection in Sunny Isles Beach is a unique automobile museum and event space with more than 1,200 vehicles on display including a Batmobile and cars from James Bond movies. A variety of shops and international restaurants line Collins Avenue, the main street of the area.
<br>
Sunny Isles Beach is a Miami seaside community with an international mix of residents who appreciate its many amenities.
